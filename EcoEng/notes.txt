components should just be containers for information.
They should have a renderer.

Entity manager will loop through components. Each component
will have an assigned tag e.g " std::string tag = "transform"; "
The system then will loop through all components in the list and then it appropriates the behaviour on the entity assigned.

Depending on what the key for the component list is the system can expect the data recieved from it.
